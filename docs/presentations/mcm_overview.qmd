## What is a chemical mechanism? 

From a mathematicla perspective, simply a set of coupled odes: 

\begin{equation} 
    \dot{\vec{y}} = f(\vec{y}, t) \qquad \vec{y}(t_0) := \vec{y}_0
\end{equation}

- $\vec{y}$ vector of chemical concentrations 
- $t$ time 
- $\vec{y}_0$ vector of initial concentrations

--- 

These equations can be written abstractly as 

\begin{equation} 
    \alpha_1 R_1 + \alpha_2 R_2 + ... \alpha_m R_m \longrightarrow \beta_1 P_1 + \beta_2 P_2 + ... + \beta_n P_n
\end{equation}

- $R_i$ are reactants 
- $P_j$ are products 
- $\alpha_i, \beta_j$ are stoichiometric coefficients 

--- 

This abstract notation is then converted into the differential equations via the translation 

\begin{equation}
    \dfrac{d[X_j]}{dt} = k \prod_i [X_i]^{\alpha_i}
\end{equation}

- $[X]$ denotes concentration of species $X$. 
- $k$ is the reaction rate coefficient. 
- $\alpha_i$ are the stoichiometric coefficients of each reactant 

---

*NOTE:* The reaction coefficient $k$ depends on the thermodynamic state of the system. 

A simple model for this is the Arrhenius equation 

\begin{equation}
    k(T) = Ae^{-E_a/(RT)}
\end{equation}

- $E_a$ is the activation energy (i.e. minimum energy required for the reaction)
- $T$ is the temperature 
- $R$ is the gas constant

## Master chemical mechanism 

*"The Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM) is a near-explicit chemical mechanism which describes the detailed gas-phase chemical processes involved in the tropospheric degradation of a series of primary emitted volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Currently, the degradation of methane and 142 non-methane VOCs is represented."*


In simpler terms, the MCM is a collection of *many* reactions as well as a definition for their corresponding reaction rates. 


## Implementation

The full mechanism is provided in a simple format for ingestion:

The authors simulate the mechanism (i.e. solve the diffeq's) with a fortran code called *AtChem*. This consists of the following components 

- **Configuration Layer**: model constraints, input / output variables, model & solver paramters 
- **Processing Layer**: conversion of mechanism to FORTRAN, sum of peroxy radicals ($\sum RO_2$), parametrization of photolysis rates
- **Logic Layer**: conversion of mechanism + configuration into ODE system + Boundary Conditions
- **Mathematical Layer**: Interpolation of constrained variables, integration of ODEs

Environemental Variables for the simulation inlcude: 

- temperature 
- pressure 
- solar angles (declination, azimuth)
- $H_2O$ 
- JFAC (scaling FACtor for photolysis rates $j_i$)

## Photolysis Rates 

Photolysis rates for the MCM are determined according to 

\begin{equation}
    j = \ell (\cos(\text{SZA}))^m e^{-(n\cdot \sec(\text{SZA}))}\tau
\end{equation}

- $\ell, m, n$ are empirical parameters (see Jenkin 1997) 
- $\text{SZA}$ is the solar zenith angle 
- $\tau$ is the transmission factor 

--- 

- $\ell, m, n$ are obtained by fitting the $j$ equation to a 2-stream isotropic scattering model. This incorporates photolysis, cross-sections, and quantum yield. 
- $\tau$ is used to account for natural/artificial light sources 
- $\text{SZA}$ is determined from solar declination, lat, lon, day of year, and time of day (Madronich 1993) 
- $\text{JFAC}= \dfrac{j_{\text{meas}}}{j_{\text{calc}}}$
